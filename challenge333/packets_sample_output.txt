5181    1   7   believe. Attack ships on fire off the 
5181    2   7   shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams 
5181    3   7   glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user 
5181    4   7   Gate. All those moments will be lost

6220    4   10  Because he can take it. 
6220    5   10  Because he's not a hero. 
6220    6   10  He's a silent guardian. 
6220    7   10  A watchful protector. 
6220    8   10  A Dark Knight.
